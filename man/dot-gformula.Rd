\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{id_var}{ID variable per subject.}

\item{base_vars}{A vector of time fixed baseline variables.}

\item{time_var}{Time variable.}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{models}{A list of models for the G-formula, including exposure model,
 covariate model (if any), mediator model (if any), outcome model or
 censoring model (if any). See details in \code{\link{spec_model}}.
 The order appeared in the list should reflect the temporal ordering of the
 variables, in another way data generation process. The model will be evaluated
in this process.}

\item{intervention}{A named list with a value of intervention on exposure.
if kept as NULL (default), the natural intervention course will be calculated.
 eg: list(natural = NULL, always = c(1, 1, 1), never = c(0, 0, 0))}

\item{in_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done before the Monte
Carlo loop starts. Needed to do any kind of functional forms for entry times.
 This is executed at each start of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps}

\item{out_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done at the
end of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations like counting the number of
days with a treatment or creating lagged variables. This is executed at each end
 of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps.}

\item{init_recode}{optional, recoding of variables done at the
beginning of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations initialize baseline variables.
This is executed at beginning of the Monte Carlo g-formula, executed only once at time 0.}

\item{mediation_type}{Type of the mediation effect.}

\item{mc_sample}{Sample size of Monte Carlo simulation.}

\item{return_fitted}{Return the fitted model (default is FALSE).}
}
\description{
This function will receive the parameters and fit model. After the model is fitted,
random samples will be drawn from the data and apply the intervention.
