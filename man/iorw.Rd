\title{Inverse odds ratio weighting.}
\usage{
iorw(data, trt, med, y, cov, time = NULL, family, ref = NULL,
  stabilized = TRUE, R = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{trt}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{med}{Name of the mediator(s).}

\item{y}{Name of the outcome variable.}

\item{cov}{A vector of the covariates' name.}

\item{time}{Survival time in survival analysis.}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the outcome model. "cox" and "aalen" can also be added for survival outcome.}

\item{ref}{Only for one categorical mediator, set to NULL for numerical mediator or multiple mediator. Reference value of the mediator, where the mediator is evaluated at its refrence value.}

\item{stabilized}{Stabilized weights, TRUE(default) or FALSE.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 1000.}
}
\description{
Mediation analysis for time fixed mediator using inverse odds ratio.
Output contains total effect, natrual direct effect and natural indirect effect.
 The confidence interval will be calculated using 1000 bootstrap with normal approximation.
