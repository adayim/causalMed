\title{Calculate Risk Difference, Risk Ratio, or Mediation Effects based on g-formula}
\usage{
risk_estimate1(data_list, ref_int, intervention, return_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{A list of simulated datasets returned by \code{.gformula}.}

\item{ref_int}{Reference intervention to compare against.}

\item{intervention}{A vector specifying the interventions to compare.}

\item{return_data}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, returns the simulated data along with effects.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with calculated effects (Risk Difference, Risk Ratio, or Mediation effects)
and, if applicable, confidence intervals. For mediation effects, the result will show
total, direct, and indirect effects.
}
\description{
These internal functions compute the Risk Difference (RD) and Risk Ratio (RR)
for g-formula estimates of the total effect, natural direct effect (NDE), 
and natural indirect effect (NIE). The functions also calculate confidence intervals 
(for RD and RR) and mediation effects based on g-formula methodology.
}
\details{
These functions are used internally within the g-formula framework for effect estimation.
They are not intended for direct user input. The functions perform:
- \code{risk_estimate1}: Computes point estimates for risk difference and risk ratio.
- \code{risk_estimate2}: Computes confidence intervals for the effects (RD/RR).
- \code{risk_estimate.mediation}: Computes total, direct, and indirect effects by subtraction.

These functions operate on the output of the \code{.gformula} function, estimating 
effects (both point estimates and confidence intervals) from simulated data.
