\title{Mediation analysis for time-varying mediaiton, survival and non-survival}
\usage{
medlong(data, id, trt, med, y, cov, time, m.family = c("binomial",
  "gaussian"), y.family = c("binomial", "gaussian"),
  estimator = c("both", "gformula", "iptw"), R = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{id}{ID variable per subject.}

\item{trt}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{med}{Name of the time-varying mediator.}

\item{y}{Name of the outcome variable.}

\item{cov}{A vector of the covariates' name.}

\item{time}{Time variable of the per row observed. Only for ordering the data.}

\item{m.family}{link function to be used in the mediator model.}

\item{y.family}{link function to be used in the outcome model.}

\item{estimator}{Use IPTW estimator or g-formula estimator or both (Default)}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 1000.}
}
\description{
Mediation analysis for time varying mediator, estimation based
 on g-formula and IPTW. Output contains total effect,
natrual direct effect and natural indirect effect. The confidence interval will
be calculated using 1000 bootstrap with normal approximation.
}
\note{
Not that final outcome must be the same for in all rows per subject.
  If the dataset is  survival settings, records after the interested outcome
   must be deleted. The funciton it self do some data manupilation internally.
   Please prepare the data as longitudinal format.
