\usage{
monte_g(
  data,
  exposure,
  time_seq,
  time_var,
  models,
  intervention = NULL,
  in_recode = NULL,
  out_recode = NULL,
  init_recode = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{time_seq}{Time sequence vector of the data.}

\item{time_var}{Time variable.}

\item{models}{A list of models for the G-formula, including exposure model,
 covariate model (if any), mediator model (if any), outcome model or
 censoring model (if any). See details in \code{\link{spec_model}}.
 The order appeared in the list should reflect the temporal ordering of the
 variables, in another way data generation process. The model will be evaluated
in this process.}

\item{intervention}{A named list with a value of intervention on exposure.
if kept as NULL (default), the natural intervention course will be calculated.
 eg: list(natural = NULL, always = c(1, 1, 1), never = c(0, 0, 0))}

\item{in_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done before the Monte
Carlo loop starts. Needed to do any kind of functional forms for entry times.
 This is executed at each start of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps}

\item{out_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done at the
end of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations like counting the number of
days with a treatment or creating lagged variables. This is executed at each end
 of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps.}

\item{init_recode}{optional, recoding of variables done at the
beginning of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations initialize baseline variables.
This is executed at beginning of the Monte Carlo g-formula, executed only once at time 0.}

\item{mediation_type}{Type of the mediation analysis, if the value is \code{NA} 
no mediation analysis will be performed (default). It will be ignored if the intervention
 is not \code{NULL}}
