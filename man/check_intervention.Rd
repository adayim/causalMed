\usage{
check_intervention(models, intervention, ref_int, time_len)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A list of models for the G-formula, including exposure model,
 covariate model (if any), mediator model (if any), outcome model or
 censoring model (if any). See details in \code{\link{spec_model}}.
 The order appeared in the list should reflect the temporal ordering of the
 variables, in another way data generation process. The model will be evaluated
in this process.}

\item{intervention}{A named list with a value of intervention on exposure.
if kept as NULL (default), the natural intervention course will be calculated.
 eg: list(natural = NULL, always = c(1, 1, 1), never = c(0, 0, 0)). Note that
the function will add the natural effect by default if the natural effect is
not define here, and the reference intervention in \code{ref_int} will be set
to the natural effect.}

\item{ref_int}{Integer or character string denoting the intervention to be used as
the reference for calculating the risk ratio and risk difference. 0 or \code{"natural"}
 denotes the natural course, while subsequent integers denote user-specified
interventions in the order that they are named in \code{intervention}. Or if the character
is the name of the intervention. The default is 0.}

\item{time_len}{length of the time in the data.}
