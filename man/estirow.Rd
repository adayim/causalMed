\title{Inverse odds ratio weighting}
\usage{
estirow(
  fitA,
  fitY,
  data,
  exposure,
  mediator,
  family,
  ref = NULL,
  stabilized = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fitA}{Exposure model formula, glm will be used in this step.}

\item{fitY}{model object of the final outcome, all variables of interest should be included except mediators.}

\item{data}{Data set to be sued, if NULL, the data from outcome model will be used.}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{mediator}{Name of the mediator(s).}

\item{family}{a description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the exposure model. Only binomial and gaussian supported now.}

\item{ref}{Only for one categorical mediator, set to NULL for numerical mediator or multiple mediator. Reference value of the mediator, where the mediator is evaluated at its refrence value.}

\item{stabilized}{Stabilized weights, TRUE(default) or FALSE.}
}
\description{
Main function for Inverse odds ratio weighting, internal use.
