\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{id.var}{ID variable per subject.}

\item{base.vars}{A vector of time fixed baseline variables.}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{outcome}{Name of the outcome variable.}

\item{time.var}{Time variable.}

\item{models}{A list of models for the G-formula, including exposure model,
 covariate model (if any), mediator model (if any), outcome model or
 censoring model (if any). See details in \code{\link{spec_model}}.
 The order appeared in the list should reflect the temporal ordering of the
 variables, in another way data generation process. The model will be evaluated 
in this process.}

\item{intervention}{A named list with a value of intervention on exposure.
if kept as NULL (default), the natural intervention course will be calculated.
 eg: list(natural = NULL, always = c(1, 1, 1), never = c(0, 0, 0))}

\item{init.recode}{optional, recoding of variables done at the
beginning of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations initialize baseline variables.
This is executed at beginning of the Monte Carlo g-formula, executed only once at time 0.}

\item{in.recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done before the Monte
Carlo loop starts. Needed to do any kind of functional forms for entry times.
 This is executed at each start of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps}

\item{out.recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done at the
end of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations like counting the number of
days with a treatment or creating lagged variables. This is executed at each end
 of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps.}

\item{mc.sample}{Sample size of Monte Carlo simulation.}

\item{verbose}{Print intervention information during calculation.}

\item{is.survival}{Is the data survival data, default is FALSE.}
}
\description{
Mediation analysis for time varying mediator, estimation based
 on g-formula. Output contains total effect, #' natrual direct effect and natural
  indirect effect for mediation or regular g-formula. data.frame will be returned.
}
\note{
Not that final outcome must be the same for in all rows per subject.
  If the dataset is  survival settings, records after the interested outcome
   must be deleted. The funciton it self do some data manupilation internally.
   Please prepare the data as longitudinal format.
