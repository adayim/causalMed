\arguments{
\item{data}{Data set to be sued}

\item{id_var}{ID variable per subject.}

\item{base_vars}{A vector of time fixed baseline variables.}

\item{exposure}{Intervention/Exposure variable}

\item{time_var}{Time variable.}

\item{models}{A list of models for the G-formula, including exposure model,
 covariate model (if any), mediator model (if any), outcome model or
 censoring model (if any). See details in \code{\link{spec_model}}.
 The order appeared in the list should reflect the temporal ordering of the
 variables, in another way data generation process. The model will be evaluated
in this process.}

\item{intervention}{A named list with a value of intervention on exposure.
if kept as NULL (default), the natural intervention course will be calculated.
 eg: list(natural = NULL, always = c(1, 1, 1), never = c(0, 0, 0)). Note that
the function will add the natural effect by default if the natural effect is
not define here, and the reference intervention in \code{ref_int} will be set
to the natural effect.}

\item{ref_int}{Integer or character string denoting the intervention to be used as
the reference for calculating the risk ratio and risk difference. 0 or \code{"natural"}
 denotes the natural course, while subsequent integers denote user-specified
interventions in the order that they are named in \code{intervention}. Or if the character
is the name of the intervention. The default is 0.}

\item{init_recode}{optional, recoding of variables done at the
beginning of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations initialize baseline variables.
This is executed at beginning of the Monte Carlo g-formula, executed only once at time 0.}

\item{in_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done before the Monte
Carlo loop starts. Needed to do any kind of functional forms for entry times.
 This is executed at each start of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps}

\item{out_recode}{optional, On the fly recoding of variables done at the
end of the Monte Carlo loop. Needed for operations like counting the number of
days with a treatment or creating lagged variables. This is executed at each end
 of the Monte Carlo g-formula time steps.}

\item{return_fitted}{Logical scalar indicating whether to return the fitted model. Default
is \code{FALSE}, only the summary of coefficients will be returned to reduce the memory usage.}

\item{mc_sample}{Integer, sample size of Monte Carlo simulation. Default is 100 times of
original sample.}

\item{return_data}{Logical scalar indicating whether to return the Monte Carlo simulated data set,
 default is \code{FALSE}. In the case of large \code{mc_sample} and long follow-up, the simulated
data will be very large causing problems no enough memory to allocate the objects.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap replicates, default is 500. If the R is larger than 1,
\code{\link[future.apply]{future_lapply}} is used for the parallel computation. This will
 run in sequential if no parallel planed, see \code{\link[future]{plan}} for more details.
If the parallel plan was set to \code{plan(multisession)} in Windows or \code{plan(multicore)}
in other system, multiple session/core is used for bootstrap calculation.}

\item{quiet}{if \code{TRUE} then the progress bar will be suppressed.}

\description{
Mediation analysis for time varying mediator, estimation based
 on g-formula. Output contains total effect, #' natural direct effect and natural
  indirect effect for mediation or regular g-formula. data.frame will be returned.
}
\note{
Not that final outcome must be the same for in all rows per subject.
  If the dataset is  survival settings, records after the interested outcome
   must be deleted. The function it self do some data manipulation internally.
   Please prepare the data as longitudinal format.
