Description: This package implements the time-varying causal mediation analysis 
    (<doi:10.1002/sim.7426> and <doi:10.1515/jci-2016-0006>). The algorithm behind this
    is based on g-formula (<doi:10.1016/0270-0255(86)90088-6>), hence the g-formula in this package
    can estimate counterfactual mean or risk under hypothetical interventions, including time-varying
    interventions, and confounders.
